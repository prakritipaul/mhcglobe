README

In folders with nomenclature "es_train_*_*_*" contain
train and es datasets generated from pMHC_data_train ("all_columns_pMHC_data_train_428364.csv") at the given date. 

These are saved because BalanceSplitData() is not deterministic. 

The training and test datasets in this directory will always be the same, because the seed was set to 428364.

Training and es are all samples- runs have differing number of samples!

example_binding_data.csv was Eric's example in the tutorial.
